This is a simple alarm application that displays a custom message at a specific time. It reads the time and message settings from a config.ini file, and when the specified time is reached, it displays a message dialog.

How to Use
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Edit the config.ini file with the desired time and the message you want to be displayed.
Run the alarm.py script.
The script will regularly check if the current time matches the configured time. When it matches, an alarm message will be displayed.
Configuration File (config.ini)
The config.ini file contains the settings for the alarm application. You can customize the time and message by editing this file.

Example config.ini:
[hour]
time = 14:32

[message]
text = COFFEE TIME!!!!

Dependencies
This application doesn't require any external libraries apart from Python's standard libraries.
